The [Groovy]-based HL7v2 DSL provides a unique programming interface for handling HL7v2 messages. 
Its API aligns very closely with natural language and the syntax of HL7v2 as often seen in specifications and requirements, 
so that translation from the language of the "HL7 world" into the language of the "developer's world" becomes redundant.

## How it works

The `ipf-modules-hl7` library is basically a [Groovy extension module] that adds the required methods to the [HAPI]
model classes. These methods are used "under the hood" by the actual DSL.

IPF 2.x used a dedicated `ipf-modules-hl7dsl` library and achieved the same goal by using adapters
wrapped around the [HAPI] model classes. With IPF 3.x, this library and all wrappers have been deprecated, and we
strongly recommend to migrate your applications. With IPF 3.4, the library has finally been removed.

## Accessing HL7 messages

The DSL offers a position-based navigation of HL7 structures and fields. It's all valid Groovy Syntax,
accomplished by operator overloading and metaclass programming, so you don't need a intermediate step that parses the
expressions (see the [Terser] class in HAPI).

### [Accessing groups and segments][hl7v2dslStructures]

Groups and segments can be accessed by name like an object property.

```groovy
    import ca.uhn.hl7v2.model.Message

    def message = parser.parse(msgTxt)
    def msh   = message.MSH
    def group = message.PATIENT_RESULT
    def pid   = message.PATIENT_RESULT.PATIENT.PID
```

Details are described [here][hl7v2dslStructures].

### [Accessing fields and field values][hl7v2dslFields]

Obtaining fields is similar to obtaining groups and segments except that fields are often referred to by number instead
of by name. Fields are accessed like an array field. Components in a composite field are accessed like a two-dimensional array.
Subcomponents are accessed like a three-dimensional array.

```groovy
    String messageType = message.MSH[9][1].value
    String street = message.PATIENT_RESULT.PATIENT.PID[11][1][1].value
```

Details are described [here][hl7v2dslFields].
{: .notice}


### Boolean conversion

All fields and structures implement an `isEmpty()` method. For Groovy, this is also used
for boolean conversion, so that checks for emptiness become even more concise:

```groovy
    if (message.MSH[9][3]) {
      println('Message structure is present')
    }
```


### [Repetitions][hl7v2dslRepetitions]

Groups, segments and fields may be repeatable. Parentheses like with regular method calls are used in order to obtain a
certain element of a repeating structure.

```groovy
    def group = message.PATIENT_RESULT(0).PATIENT
    def nk1   = group.NK1(1)
```

Details are described [here][hl7v2dslRepetitions].
{: .notice}

### [Smart navigation][hl7v2dslSmart]

Accessing HL7 messages as described above usually requires knowledge about the specified message structure,
which is often not visible by looking at the printed message.
To make things worse, the internal structure changes between HL7 versions. In more recent versions, primitive types are
sometimes replaced with composite types having the so far used primitive as first component.
This appears to be backwards compatible on printed messages, but requires different DSL expressions when obtaining field values.

Smart navigation resolves these problems by assuming reasonable defaults when repetitions or component operators are omitted

```groovy
    assert group.NK1(0)[2][1][1].value == group.NK1[2].value
```

Details are described [here][hl7v2dslSmart].
{: .notice}

### [Iterative functions][hl7v2dslIteration]

As HL7 messages are compound structures, it should be possible to traverse them. Thus, the HL7 DSL implements iterators for
HL7 messages and groups. Due to their nested structures, iteration is implemented as a depth first traversal over all
non-empty substructures, i.e. non-empty groups and segments.

```groovy
    import ca.uhn.hl7v2.model.Message

    boolean hasGroups = message.any { it instanceof Group }
    def allStructureNames = message*.name
```

Details are described [here][hl7v2dslIteration].
{: .notice}

## [Creating HL7 messages][hl7v2dslcreating] (and their internal structures)

New messages can be created from scratch by just specifying HL7 event type, trigger event and version, i.e. it is not required to know
about the object type to be instantiated.
The message header fields are populated with the event type, trigger event, version, the current time as message date, and the common separators.

Just as creating a message, segments and fields can be created without actually knowing their respective type.

Details are described [here][hl7v2dslcreating].
{: .notice}

## [Manipulating HL7 messages][hl7v2dslManipulation]

Message manipulation is as straightforward as read access. You navigate to a segment or field and assign it a new object or String value.

Details are described [here][hl7v2dslManipulation].

## Parsing and Rendering HL7 messages

IPF does not change or extend [HAPI] on how to parse or render HL7 message.
