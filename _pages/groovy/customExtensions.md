Custom DSL extensions implement the
[`org.openehealth.ipf.commons.core.extend.config.DynamicExtension`](../apidocs/org/openehealth/ipf/commons/core/extend/config/DynamicExtension.html)
 marker interface in order to be picked up and activated from its corresponding extension configurer.

The following Groovy script `CustomModelExtension.groovy` defines a simple extension to the Camel DSL:

```groovy

    package org.openehealth.ipf.tutorial.config.extend

    import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder
    import org.openehealth.ipf.commons.core.extend.config.DynamicExtension

    class CustomModelExtensionModule implements DynamicExtension {

        static RouteBuilder direct(RouteBuilder delegate, String endpointName) {
            delegate.from('direct:' + endpointName)
        }

    }

```

In addition a bean needs to be defined in thecustom spring context file, running in the same Spring application context as the base application:

```xml

    ...
    <lang:groovy id="customExtension"
         script-source="classpath:org/openehealth/ipf/tutorial/config/extend/CustomModelExtension.groovy" />
    ...

```

Note that in this case the Groovy meta class extension is loaded *after* the complete Spring application context has been
initialized.
Thus, the extensions are not available during that initialization process, so static Camel route builders - i.e.
those that are directly configured in the `CamelContext` bean - are not able to depend on them. Instead, these Camel route builders
must be initialized as [Custom Route Builders] as well.
