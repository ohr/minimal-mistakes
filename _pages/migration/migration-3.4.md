IPF 3.4 comes with some changes that must be considered when upgrading from IPF 3.2 or IPF 3.3 to IPF 3.4.


## FHIR-based IHE transaction modules changes

The module ihe-modules-fhir has been removed. There was no code, the module only contributed 3rd party dependencies.

The following classes were deprecated:

* `org.openehealth.ipf.platform.camel.ihe.fhir.translation.FhirCamelTranslators` : use `org.openehealth.ipf.platform.camel.ihe.fhir.core.FhirCamelTranslators`
* `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.fhir.pixpdq.translation.TranslatorFhirToHL7v2` : use `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.fhir.translation.FhirTranslator<Message>`
* `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.fhir.pixpdq.translation.TranslatorHL7v2ToFhir` : use `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.fhir.translation.ToFhirTranslator<Message>`


The following deprecated classes have been removed:

* `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.fhir.CamelFhirServlet`
* `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.fhir.AuditRecordTranslator`
* `org.openehealth.ipf.platform.camel.ihe.fhir.iti78.Iti78Configuration`
* `org.openehealth.ipf.platform.camel.ihe.fhir.iti83.Iti83Configuration`

The following backwards-incompatible changes were done:

* `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.fhir.CamelFhirServlet` now requires to be initialized with a fhirVersion parameter ('DSTU2_HL7ORG' or 'DSTU3')
* `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.fhir.FhirSearchParameters` defines a new method `getIncludeSpec()` in order to store `_include` and `_revinclude` response modifiers


Due to adding FHIR-based IHE transactions for the STU3 version of FHIR, modules were split up into 
ones that are independent of a specific FHIR version and ones that depend on a specific FHIR version. Most generic
functionality was already version-independent, but IHE transaction functionality obviously requires the appropriate
FHIR resource classes.

Adjust your dependencies to include specifically either the `-dstu2-` or `-stu3-` modules, e.g. 
instead of `ipf-platform-ihe-fhir-pixpdq` use either `ipf-platform-ihe-fhir-dstu2-pixpdq` or `ipf-platform-ihe-fhir-stu3-pixpdq`.

Note that all DSTU2 code is effectively deprecated, i.e. no bugs or changes will be applied anymore, and related
modules will be removed in one of the upcoming releases. STU3 modules are actively supported, until one day IHE moves to STU4, etc.

## Boolean conversion for HL7 fields and structures

The HL7 DSL now allows to check for empty fields or structures using 'Groovy truth', i.e.

`if (!PID[3]) println('no identifiers')`

## XDS SourcePatientInfo

The class `org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.xds.core.metadata.PatientInfo` has been completely rewritten.  
Now it supports arbitrary PID fields (including multiple repetitions) and provides the possibility to access
and manipulate unparsed HL7 representations of them.  In addition, selected PID fields remain accessible
as XDS metadata objects.  These two representations (HL7 strings and XDS metadata) are synchronized with each other.

The method `getHl7FieldIterator(String fieldId)` returns an iterator over unparsed repetitions of an PID field
(also for non-repeatable fields).  Methods `getIds()`, `getNames()`, `getAddresses()` return iterators over
lists of XDS metadata objects `Identifiable` (for PID-3), `Name` (for PID-5), `Address` (for PID-11), respectively.
Whenever corresponding objects are inserted to or deleted from these lists, the corresponding items in the
HL7 string collections are automatically updated.  Whenever an object is modified in-place, it must be 
"committed" using of a call to `set()`, e.g:

```
ListIterator<Name> iter = patientInfo.getNames();
Name name = iter.next();
name.setFamilyName("Krusenstern");
iter.set(name);   // this statement is absolutely essential!

```

Methods `getDateOfBirth()/setDateOfBirth()` and `getGender()/setGender()` provide access to XDS metadata elements
for HL7 fields PID-7 and PID-8.  These methods touch only first elements in the corresponding HL7 string collections,
because PID-7 and PID-8 are not repeatable. 

For further information and code samples, please take a look at the classes 
`org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.xds.core.metadata.PatientInfo` and
`org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.xds.core.transform.hl7.pid.PatientInfoTest`.


## Simplified creation of ITI-43/ITI-86 requests from existing DocumentEntries

In the simplified XDS data model, the new method `addReferenceTo(DocumentEntry entry)` in the classes 
`org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.xds.core.requests.RetrieveDocumentSet` and
`org.openehealth.ipf.commons.ihe.xds.core.requests.RemoveDocuments` 
provides a convenient way to add a reference to the document, represented by the given document entry, 
to an ITI-43 or an ITI-86 request.


## IHE Profile Updates

IPF 3.4 is compatible with IHE ITI Revision 14 (published on July 21, 2017), including changes from the following Change Proposals:


## Camel DSL HL7 extensions deprecated

Due to the removal of `ipf-modules-hl7-dsl`, the deprecated `ghl7()` Camel DSL extensions now
operate on plain HAPI HL7 Message objects rather than the removed `MessageAdapter`. All HL7-
related Camel DSL extensions are now deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent IPF version.


## OSGi support

OSGi support has been abandoned


## Notice: Removal of deprecated functionality in IPF 3.5

The following deprecated classes will be eventually removed in IPF 3.5

* all deprecated classes in `ipf-modules-hl7`, particularly the old validation rule builders
