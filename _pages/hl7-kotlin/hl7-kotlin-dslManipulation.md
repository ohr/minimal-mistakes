## Manipulating HL7 messages

Message manipulation is as straightforward as read access. You navigate to a segment or field and assign it a new object or `String` value.

### Manipulating segments

Segments can be replaced. Currently only segments can be assigned, assignment to groups isn't supported yet.

```kotlin
    // copy over EVN segment from msg2 to msg1

    // assignment operator
    msg1["EVN"] = msg2["EVN"]

    // recommended equivalent
    msg1["EVM"].from(msg2["EVN"])
```


### Manipulating fields

To change a field value, navigate to the field (either by name or index) and either assign it a string value or another field. 
Again, fields may also be assigned using the `from()` method.

```kotlin
    val nk1      = message["PATIENT_RESULT"]["PATIENT"]["NK1", 0]
    val otherNk1 = message["PATIENT_RESULT"]["PATIENT"]["NK1", 1]

    // assignment operator
    nk1[4]       = otherNk1[4]       // copy address
    nk1[4][4]    = otherNk1[4][4]    // copy state or province only

    // equivalent
    nk1[4][4].from(otherNk1[4][4])

    // set state or province to a string value
    nk1[4][4]    = "NY"
```


### Adding repetitions

There are two ways to add a repeating element: explicitly and implicitly.

Explicitly calling `nrp()` (for "new repetition") adds an element and returns it to the caller. 
The argument is of type `String` for repeating structures or `int` for repeating fields:

```kotlin

    // Adding a PATIENT group
    val newPatientGroup = message["PATIENT_RESULT"].nrp("PATIENT")

    // Adding a NK1 segment
    val newContactSegment = message["PATIENT_RESULT"]["PATIENT"].nrp("NK1")

    // adding a field (NK1-4)
    val newAddress = message["PATIENT_RESULT"]["PATIENT"]["NK1"].nrp(4)
```

Implicitly, an element is also added if you access a repetition that does not exist yet:

```kotlin
    val message       = ORU_R01()
    val patientResult = message["PATIENT_RESULT"](0)          // add a PATIENT_RESULT group
    val order         = patientResult["ORDER_OBSERVATION"](0) // add a ORDER_OBSERVATION group
    val observation   = order["OBSERVATION"](0)               // add a OBSERVATION group
    val obx5          = observation["OBX"][5]                 // add a OBX-5 field
```

Together with the [Smart Navigation][hl7v2dslSmart] feature, it is particularly convenient that accessing a repeated element 
without index does a default to its first repetition. Hence, the code above can be condensed to:

```kotlin
    val message = ORU_R01()
    val obx5    = message["PATIENT_RESULT"]["ORDER_OBSERVATION"]["OBSERVATION"]["OBX"][5]
```

### Handling content types of OBX segments

The type of data contained in the fifth field of each `OBX` segment is variable and determined by the second field. 
In other words, when `OBX-2` equals to `"CE"`, `OBX-5` contains repeating instances of type `CE`.

To set data type in a newly created OBX segment or to change the type in an existing segment, 
the following approach using the `setObx5Type()` method can be used:

```kotlin

    // set type 'CE' for repetitions of OBX-5 and ensure that
    // at least 2 such repetitions are available
    val obx = message["PATIENT_RESULT"]["ORDER_OBSERVATION"]["OBSERVATION"]["OBX"]
    obx.setObx5Type("CE")

    obx[5](0)[1] = "T57000"
    obx[5](0)[2] = "GALLBLADDER"
    obx[5](0)[3] = "SNM"
```
